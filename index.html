                        <h2>About The Museum</h2>
                        <p>Around 1.5 million visitors every year enjoy the exhibitions in the museum, which describe the warship Vasa's history and life at the time; how, after 333 years at the bottom of Stockholm bay, the ship was rediscovered and salvaged; and the research which is now underway to preserve Vasa. The Vasa Museum lies in the royal parkland, Djurgården, in Stockholm.
                            The Vasa Museum is a part of the Swedish National Maritime and Transport Museums, together with the Maritime Museum and Vrak - Museum of Wrecks in Stockholm, the Naval Museum in Karlskrona and the Railway Museum in GävleThe Vasa Museum is one of Scandinavia's most visited museums. It is here that you will find in all its glory, the unique and well preserved warship Vasa from 1628, embellished with hundreds of wooden sculptures.
                            With the current situation in mind, the Vasa Museum has taken several precautions to make your visit as safe as possible. Instead of guided tours, you can explore the museum with an audioguide. Simply download on your own device and take the time you need. The audioguide is available in different languages.

            <p>
                What started with church services and a festive atmosphere ended in a watery grave. It was the 10th of August 1628, when Vasa, the most powerful warship in the Baltic, foundered in Stockholm harbour before the eyes of a large audience, scant minutes after setting sail for the first time.

                It was mid-afternoon when at last it was time. After many delays, frustrations with the supply of guns, and a change of captain, the newly fitted out Vasa was anchored below the castle, with its cannon finally on board and the crew manning their stations. The quay was packed with people and the water teemed with small craft carrying people who wanted to watch the mighty war machine slip its moorings and sail from Stockholm.

                The crew had been allowed to bring their families, as it was the ship's maiden voyage. The guests, including women and children, would disembark at the fortress of Vaxholm before the ship continued to the summer fleet base on the island of Älvsnabben in the Stockholm archipelago. There it would be the flagship of the reserve squadron, awaiting further orders as to whether to reinforce the blockade of Gdańsk in the stalemated, bloody war against Poland-Lithuania or to join the Swedish squadron protecting the German port of Stralsund. Only then would the ship's complement of marines, two companies of soldiers totalling 300 men and officers, come aboard. But the soldiers were never to set foot on Vasa.

                10 August 1628 was a Sunday, and many of Vasa's crew had received communion earlier in the day. Hopes were high as people bid farewell or followed the ship from the quay, but some aboard the ship were worried.

                        Vasa cast off from the palace between four and five o'clock. Perhaps musicians struck up a suitably martial tune. Because the wind was from the south, the ship had to be warped with the help of anchors along the waterfront to the other end of the city island, to the place now called Slussen. Here, she could pick up the current that would take her down the harbour. As the ship found the current, the last warp was cast off, Vasa was freed from the land, four of the ten sails were set, and a salute was fired.
        
                        There was little wind under the bluffs of Södermalm, not even enough to pull the sheets of the sails taught, and Vasa drifted on the current, not answering her helm. A small gust filled the sails, and the ship heeled to port, but slowly, agonizingly recovered. As the ship passed the gap in the bluffs at Tegelviken, a much stronger gust pushed the ship so far over on its port side that water poured in through the open gunports on the lower gundeck. Vasa began to sink.
                        
                        Pandemonium reigned on deck. The captain ordered the sheets cast off to spill the wind from the sails and the gunports closed. Vice Admiral Erik Jönsson ran below to make sure the cannon had not broken loose. Many threw themselves into the water, while those below decks struggled to make their way up wildly tilting ladders. Within minutes, the ship was on the sea bed at a depth of 32 metres. The masts stuck up above the surface, and many grabbed hold of them. Others were picked up by the small craft that had followed Vasa's shaky journey at close quarters. Some swam the 120 metres to the shore of Beckholmen.

            <h2>Collections</h2>
            <p>
                Work to document Vasa is a continuing process. The ship and its collection of objects provide a rich source of knowledge.

                We are continually documenting objects in the collection. Such work consists of studying, measuring and photographing objects, as well as assessing their condition. The objects' appearance, possible damage and special features are recorded. Sometimes 3-d digital drawings are made using a measuring device called a Faro-Arm. This work is often done in front of the public in the museum.

                All the information is gathered in our database, which is accessible to the general public. In the database, you can learn more about the objects, how they were used on board and where on the ship they were found. The database is continually updated as new information is discovered.
