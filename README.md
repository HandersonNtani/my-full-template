# MY FIRST WEBPAGE README.md!

[Mock-up](images/mock-up.PNG) this screen shot depicts my Portfolio Project to be submitted for assassment at Code Institute where i am studying. it is a Static Frontend site with basice HTML and CSS. I chose the Historical Website of the VIKING BOAT Museum. 

[Header](images/header.PNG) The header section has Navigation elements which animates to the various pages when clicked upon. the Font Family of Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif and the H2 and H3 with Cursive font types. the color was clearfully calculated with repect to UX.

[Form](images/form.PNG). The form contains inputs and labels with placeholders spiced with a :hover background-color of teal. this was selected to improve the user exprience that hints the user to fill up the blank spaces.

[Section-1](section1.PNG) Section 1 was about the brief history of this boats the Viking wars. A recap of the basic information about the museum and the number of visitors yearly.

[Section-2](section-2.PNG) The section two contains the picture and eplanation how the boat was created and some minute details of the history. 

[Section-3](section-3.PNG) This section depicts the collection section. i used a red color to blend it with the beautiful picture. The two pictures in the collection section show a bit of what can be seen in the museum, and how beautiful they look.

[Footer](footer.PNG) The footer section was very well designed with the help of the source code from Coder's Coffee House Project of the class. it was perfectly done am i appreciate the work of our tutors. The color matches with the header to give some uniformity and uniqueness. 

# Deployment

-Github/Gitpod 
[Github](images/Github.PNG) i created a Github and Gitpod account and started my code in accordance with the lessons on how to start a first repository on Git. after the creation of the account i went on to create a New Workspace on Gitpod where i created 3 files using the dropdown bar because i wasn't informed enough with Git Terminal. after the lesson on terminal and Git Commands, i count be able to start commit and making pushes to github with no stress using git commit -m "..." enter
then git push "Enter" then i change versions of my code.
