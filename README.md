I wish to stipulate here that pictures were downloaded from https://www.vasamuseet.se/ 
purposely for studies and not for anything else. wanna thank Annelli Karlsson for such 
brilliant pictures and respect his rights to them.
other trouble-shooting tools were employed for intance google search, 
Youtube.com and even Code institute mark-up on Coders Coffee House.
very much thanks goes to the slack community and my mentor Adegbenga Adeye.

I had challenges in making my project responsive still struggling to get used too media querries 
so that i can easily sort troubles like this easily. i used very little or none of tutoring time 
maybe more next time.
This picture depicts the mock-up of my portfolio project https://i.imgur.com/wsuhZuj.png
