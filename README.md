I wish to stipulate here that pictures were downloaded from https://www.vasamuseet.se/ 
purposely for studies and not for anything else. wanna thank Annelli Karlsson for such 
brilliant pictures and respect his rights to them.
other trouble-shooting tools were employed for intance google search, 
Youtube.com and even Code institute mark-up on Coders Coffee House.
very much thanks goes to the slack community and my mentor Adegbenga Adeye.
